All players will be dealt dealt 4 cards and a clock that starts at 12:00 pm.
At the start of every turn but the first one all players will draw a card from a shared pile.
Letâ€™s play: 
All players make their plays at the same time in parallel. The play order is chosen randomly at the start of the game.
	Turn structure:
Draw phase: draw a card from the top of the deck. In the first turn there won't be a draw.
Main phase: 
Select a card to play this turn (you can only play one card by turn and you must play one).
Confirm your selected card for the turn.
Show Phase: The effects of the cards resolve in player order until completion.
Tick phase: all players have a number of hours/minutes that add passively at the end of the round to the clock. These are called the passive ticks.
End phase: if one or more players reach 12:00 am by the end of the turn, all of them win!
